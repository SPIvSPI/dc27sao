SPIvSPI Firmware
================

This code was written in a mad rush while exhausted, and sucks. It
was our first time with 8051 and the EFM8 chip. In retrospect, we should
have done procedural animation instead of frame-based, but we went with
the first thing that started working and iterated until we had anything
that we could deliver. Ended up with a neato gui tool at least :)

To build, use Simplicity Studio from SiLabs. We used version SV4.1.11.0
with Keil 8051 v9.53.

The file `snky.h` is not for you! Sneaky challenge stuff. SNEAKY!
